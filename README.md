# Melf

Melf is a GELF broker specially designed to handle multi-line logs generated by Docker GELF log driver.

# How It Works

1. Listen at a UDP port, accept standard GELF logs.

2. Use `_instance_id` field (set by Docker GELF log driver), identify different log sequences.

3. Evaluate rules to determine whether message should be reassembled with previous one.

4. Send new GELF message to the real endpoint.

# Limits

* Only Gzip and chuncked Gzip are supported

# Usage

`melf -b 127.0.0.1:12202 -t 127.0.0.1:12201 -r W`

* b, bind UDP address

* t, target UDP address

* r, combination of multiple rules

  * W - Regard whitespace leading messages as multi-line message
